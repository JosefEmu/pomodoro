The **Pomodoro Technique** is a simple yet effective way to manage your time and improve your work habits. It helps you break down your workload into small, manageable chunks. This technique helps you stay focused on tasks that require long periods of concentration.

The Pomodoro Technique was created by software developer and entrepreneur **Francesco Cirillo**.

# The App

To improve on productivity, the program will notify you on when to work and take a break. Work for a duration of **30 minutes** then take a short break of **10 minutes**, do this repeatedly up to 3 times to make 1 Pomodoro run. 

Take a long break **30 minutes** after every Pomodoro run.

## Running the App

Using the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosefEmu/pomodoro
cd pomodoro
python "Pomodoro_Timer.py"
```
and hit Run!

## Get Sh*t done!!!
